    <i>Five Nights at Freddy's 3 is the third installment in the popular horror video game series created by Scott Cawthon. Set 30 years after the events of the first two games, Five Nights at Freddy's 3 takes place in Fazbear's Fright: The Horror Attraction, a horror-themed attraction based on the infamous Freddy Fazbear's Pizza.

        In this game, players take on the role of a night security guard hired to watch over the attraction during the night shift. However, unlike the previous games where players monitor security cameras and doors, Five Nights at Freddy's 3 introduces a new gameplay mechanic in the form of the security system's maintenance panel. Players must use this panel to reboot systems, seal off vents, and fend off attacks from the lone animatronic antagonist, Springtrap.
        
        Springtrap, a worn and decayed version of the iconic animatronic character, is the main threat in Five Nights at Freddy's 3. Players must strategically use audio cues, cameras, and the ventilation system to lure Springtrap away and prevent him from reaching the security office. The game's atmosphere is tense and unsettling, with a focus on jump scares and a feeling of constant dread as players navigate the dark and eerie setting of Fazbear's Fright.
        
        Five Nights at Freddy's 3 continues the series' tradition of delivering a heart-pounding and immersive horror experience. With new gameplay elements, a compelling storyline, and a chilling atmosphere, this installment offers players a fresh and terrifying challenge as they try to survive five nights in the haunted attraction.</i>
