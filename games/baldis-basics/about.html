    <i>Baldi's Basics is a wacky and entertaining indie horror game developed by Micah McGonagall (MystMan12). The game takes place in a seemingly ordinary school where the player takes on the role of a student who must collect all seven notebooks hidden throughout the school while avoiding the clutches of the strict and menacing teacher, Baldi. 

        The game is notorious for its challenging gameplay, quirky characters, and retro-inspired graphics. Each notebook the player collects contains a series of math problems that must be solved in order to progress. However, as the player solves more problems, Baldi becomes increasingly aggressive and relentless in his pursuit. 
        
        Players must navigate through the school's hallways, classrooms, and hidden passages in order to collect the notebooks and escape Baldi's wrath. Along the way, they will encounter other eccentric characters such as Principal of the Thing, Playtime, and It's a Bully, each with their own unique abilities and challenges.
        
        Baldi's Basics has gained a cult following for its nostalgic 90s educational game aesthetic, unexpected jump scares, and surreal sense of humor. The game's unpredictable and chaotic nature keeps players on their toes and provides a thrilling and unpredictable gaming experience. Whether you're a fan of horror games, puzzle-solving, or just looking for something out of the ordinary, Baldi's Basics is sure to keep you entertained and on the edge of your seat.</i>
